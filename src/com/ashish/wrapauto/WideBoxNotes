Widening is transforming a variable in another with a wider type.
Widening can be done with primitive or reference types.

For example :

String -> Object
int -> long

Rules:
1. Widening wins over boxing and var-args
2. Boxing wins over var-args
3. Widening of reference variable depends on inheritance(so, Integer cannot be widened to Long. But, Integer widened to Number).
4. Boxing and widening is possible	  
[int -{Boxing}-> Integer, Integer -{Widening}-> Number] = (Possible)
5. Widening and boxing is not possible 
[Integer -{Widening}-> Number -{Boxing}-> ?? , Number can't be Boxed since no Wrapper for it. ] = (Not Possible)
6. var-args can be combined with either boxing or widening
