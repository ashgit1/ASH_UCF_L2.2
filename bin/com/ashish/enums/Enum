Java Enum:

Enum in java is a data type that contains fixed set of constants.
It can be used for days of the week (SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY and SATURDAY) , 
directions (NORTH, SOUTH, EAST and WEST) etc. The java enum constants are static and final implicitly. 
It is available from JDK 1.5.

Java Enums can be thought of as classes that have fixed set of constants.

Points to remember for Java Enum:
1. enum improves type safety
2. enum can be easily used in switch
3. enum can be traversed
4. enum can have fields, constructors and methods
5. enum may implement many interfaces but cannot extend any class because it internally extends Enum class.

What is the purpose of values() method in enum?
The java compiler internally adds the values() method when it creates an enum. The values() method returns an 
array containing all the values of the enum.

The java compiler internally creates a static and final class that extends the Enum class:
public static final class EnumExample1$Sport extends Enum.  

Defining Java enum:
The enum can be defined within or outside the class because it is similar to a class.

** Constructor of enum type is private. If you don't declare private compiler internally creates private constructor.

Can we create the instance of enum by new keyword?
No, because it contains private constructors only.

Can we have abstract method in enum?
Yes, ofcourse! we can have abstract methods and can provide the implementation of these methods.

Java enum in switch statement:
We can apply enum on switch statement
