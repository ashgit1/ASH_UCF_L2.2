Variable Argument (Varargs):

The varrags allows the method to accept zero or muliple arguments. 
Before varargs either we use overloaded method or take an array as the method parameter
but it was not considered good because it leads to the maintenance problem. 
If we don't know how many argument we will have to pass in the method, varargs is the better approach.

Advantage of Varargs:
We don't have to provide overloaded methods so less code.

Syntax of varargs:
The varargs uses ellipsis i.e. three dots after the data type. Syntax is as follows:

return_type method_name(data_type... variableName){}

Rules for varargs:
While using the varargs, you must follow some rules otherwise program code won't compile. The rules are as follows:

1. There can be only one variable argument in the method.
2. Variable argument (varargs) must be the last argument.

Examples of varargs that fails to compile:

void method(String... a, int... b){}//Compile time error    
void method(int... a, String b){}//Compile time error    

Example of Varargs that is the last argument in the method:
eg: VarargsExample2.java
