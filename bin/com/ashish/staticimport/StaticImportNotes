Static Import:

The static import feature of Java 5 facilitate the java programmer to access any static member of a class directly. 
There is no need to qualify it by the class name.

Advantage of static import:
Less coding is required if you have access any static member of a class often.

Disadvantage of static import:
If you overuse the static import feature, it makes the program unreadable and unmaintainable.


What is the difference between import and static import?
The import allows the java programmer to access classes/interfaces of a package without package qualification 
whereas the static import feature allows to access the static members of a class without the class qualification. 
The import provides accessibility to classes and interface whereas static import provides accessibility 
to static members of the class.
