JCA:
Java EE Connector Architecture (JCA) is a Java-based technology solution for connecting 
application servers and enterprise information systems (EIS) as part of 
enterprise application integration (EAI) solutions. 
While JDBC is specifically used to connect Java EE applications to databases, 
JCA is a more generic architecture for connection to legacy systems.
