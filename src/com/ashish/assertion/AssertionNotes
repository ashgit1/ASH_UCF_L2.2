Assertion:
----------

Assertion is a statement in java. It can be used to test your assumptions about the program.
While executing assertion, it is believed to be true. If it fails, JVM will throw an error named AssertionError. 
It is mainly used for testing purpose.

Advantage of Assertion:
-----------------------

It provides an effective way to detect and correct programming errors.

Syntax of using Assertion:
There are two ways to use assertion. 

First way is:
assert expression; 

Second way is:
assert expression1 : expression2;

-----------------------------------------------
assert booleanExpression;
assert booleanExpression : errorMessage;
-----------------------------------------------

Running the program:
If you use assertion, It will not run simply because assertion is disabled by default. 
To enable the assertion, -ea or -enableassertions switch of java must be used.
Compile it by: javac AssertionExample.java
Run it by: java -ea AssertionExample


Where not to use Assertion:
---------------------------

There are some situations where assertion should be avoided. They are:
1. According to Sun Specification, assertion should not be used to check arguments in the public methods 
because it should result in appropriate runtime exception e.g. IllegalArgumentException, NullPointerException etc.
[public method should always check its argument and throw appropriate exception e.g. IllegalArgumentException]

2. Do not use assertion, if you don't want any error in any situation.

3. (**) It is not correct to handle assertion failures using a catch clause.

4. assertion can be enable and disable at run time by using switch -da or -disableassertion

5. Always remember Assertion does not replace Exception but compliments it.

6. Another important point is Assertion also doesn't replace need of unit testing 
instead if you see JUnit it shows how assertion can be useful to validate conditions.

Note:
If you are working in java version 1.2 you can compile your code with assertion as below:
javac -source 1.4 OnlineStockTradingDemo.java
