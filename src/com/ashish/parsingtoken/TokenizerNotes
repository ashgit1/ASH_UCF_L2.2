Counts the number of times the word "cat" appears in the input string.
This example uses word boundaries(\b) to ensure that the letters "c" "a" "t" are not merely a substring in a longer word.
The find() finds the next subsequence of the input sequence that matches the pattern.
The start() method returns the start index of the subsequence.
The end() returns the index of the last character matched, plus one.

\d	Matches digits. Equivalent to [0-9].
\D	Matches nondigits.
\A	Matches beginning of string.
\b	Matches word boundaries (cat caty[1 cat])
\B	Matches nonword boundaries. (cat caty[2 cat]) 
re*	Matches 0 or more occurrences of preceding expression.

The matches() and lookingAt() methods both attempt to match an input sequence against a pattern. 
The difference, however, is that matches requires the entire input sequence to be matched, while lookingAt does not.
The replaceFirst() and replaceAll() methods replace text that matches a given regular expression. 
As their names indicate, replaceFirst replaces the first occurrence, and replaceAll replaces all occurrences.
The Matcher class also provides appendReplacement() and appendTail() methods for text replacement.
